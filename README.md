# Hi!

This is the source code for my personal website. I use this project as a resource to try new techniques while having something to apply them to.
It also serves as a portfolio where I can show some of my projects. However, it most likely does not contain all of my projects as I have made quite a lot of them. But I try to update it from time to time!
